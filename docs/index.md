# Streaming Online Data Transformation!

Data Pipes is a service to provide streaming, "pipe-like" data transformations on the web &ndash; things like deleting rows or columns, find and replace, head, grep etc.

To illustrate here's a live example:

[/csv/head -n 50/cut 0/delete 1:7/grep LONDON/html?url=https&#58;//raw.github.com/okfn/datapipes/master/test/data/gla.csv][ex]

[ex]: /csv/head%20-n%2050/cut%200/delete%201:7/grep%20LONDON/html?url=https://raw.github.com/okfn/datapipes/master/test/data/gla.csv

Crudely this does the following: parses the incoming url as CSV, slices out the first 50 rows ([head][]), then cuts column 0 ([cut][]), then deletes rows 1-5 ([delete][]), then filters for all rows with LONDON in them ([grep][]), and finally transforms to HTML output ([html][]).

## API

The basic API is of the form:

    /csv/{transform} {args}/?url={source-url}&other-options...

For example, here is a head operation which shows first n rows or a file (default case with no arguments will show first 10 lines):

    /csv/head/?url={source-url}

With arguments (showing first 20 rows):

    /csv/head -n 20/?url={source-url}

### Piping

You can also do **piping**, that is pass output of one transformation as input to another:

    /csv/{trans1} {args}/{trans2} {args}/.../?url={source-url}

### Input Formats

At present we only support CSV but we are considering support for JSON, plain text and RSS.

*If you are Interested in [JSON support then vote here][json-issue])*

### CORS and JS web apps

CORS is supported so you can use this from pure JS web apps.

## Transform Operations

The basic operations are inspired by unix-style commands such `head`, `cut`, `grep`, `sed` but really anything a map function can do could be supported ([suggest new operations here][suggest]).

[suggest]: https://github.com/okfn/datapipes/issues

* [none][] (aka raw) = no transform but file parsed (useful with CORS)
* [csv][] = parse / render csv
* [html][] = render as viewable HTML table
* [delete][] = delete rows
* [head][] = take only first X rows
* [tail][] = take only last X rows
* [strip][] = delete all blank rows
* [cut][] = select / delete columns
* [grep][] = filter rows based on pattern matching
* sed = find and replace (not yet implemented)

[none]: /none/
[csv]: /csv/
[delete]: /delete/
[grep]: /grep/
[head]: /head/
[tail]: /tail/
[strip]: /strip/
[html]: /html/
[cut]: /cut/
