# Streaming Online Data Transformation!

Data Pipes is a service to provide streaming, "pipe-like" data transformations on the web &ndash; things like deleting rows or columns, find and replace, head, grep etc.

At present we **only handle CSV files** &ndash; they stream very naturally!

*(Interested in [JSON support then vote here][json-issue])*

## API

The basic API is of the form:

    /csv/{transform} {args}/?url={source-url}&other-options...

For example, here is a head operation which shows first n rows or a file (default case with no arguments will show first 10 lines):

    /csv/head/?url={source-url}

With arguments (showing first 20 rows):

    /csv/head -n 20/?url={source-url}

### Piping

You can also do **piping**, that is pass output of one transformation as input to another:

    /csv/{trans1} {args}/{trans2} {args}/.../?url={source-url}

Here's an example:

<a href="/csv/head%20-n%2050/cut 0/delete%201:7/grep%20LONDON/html?url=https://raw.github.com/okfn/datapipes/master/test/data/gla.csv">
/csv/head -n 50/cut 0/delete 1:7/grep LONDON/html?url=https://raw.github.com/okfn/datapipes/master/test/data/gla.csv
</a>

Crudely this says: slice out the first 50 rows ([head][]), then cut column 0 ([cut][]),
then delete rows 1-5 ([delete][]), then filter for all rows with LONDON in them
([grep][]), and finally transform to HTML output ([html][]).

### CORS and JS web apps

CORS is supported so you can use this from pure JS web apps.

## Transform Operations

The basic operations are inspired by unix-style commands such `head`, `cut`, `grep`, `sed` but really anything a map function can do could be supported ([suggest new operations here][suggest]).

[suggest]: https://github.com/okfn/datapipes/issues

* [none](/csv/none/) (aka raw) = no transform but file parsed (useful with CORS)
* [html][] = render as viewable HTML table
* [delete][] = delete rows
* [head][] = take only first X rows
* [cut][] = select / delete columns (not yet implemented)
* [grep][] = filter rows based on pattern matching
* sed = find and replace (not yet implemented)

[delete]: /csv/delete/
[grep]: /csv/grep/
[head]: /csv/head/
[html]: /csv/html/
[cut]: /csv/cut/
